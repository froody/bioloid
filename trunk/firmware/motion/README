This is some basic firmware for the CM-510 (included in the Bioloid Premium kit)

To build, simply type make, this will spit out the bl.hex file (which is acually a binary file ready to be uploaded via serial). You can change the makefile to spit out a file in ihex format.

To upload, use the included bioloid_upload script. It's python and requires pyserial, and if it's in your path then `make upload` will do the right thing (though you'll have to point it at your serial port). Run this before turning your CM-510 on, you should see 3 LEDs flash momentarily if it's working and the bootloader will print "Got prompt". If for some reason you can't get this to connect then:

1) open a serial terminal, hold '#' and turn on the CM-510
2) Press return
3) Type 'SYS' and press return
4) Close the terminal and run bioloid_upload
5) Turn on your CM-510
6) When bioloid_upload exits go back to step (1) but instead of typing SYS, type APP, then your code should run

The default behaviour is to execute poses starting at 0x1E000. The code is really hacky and it only plays the first pose from each page, but hey, it's a start!

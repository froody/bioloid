DynamixelMonitor Help
</h1>
<p>
DynamixelMonitor is a simple application that can control <a href="http://www.robotis.com/zbxe/dynamixel_en">Dynamixel servos</a> through a 
USB2Dynamixel from <a href="http://www.robotis.com">ROBOTIS</a> and presumably also other USB-to-Serial interfaces. The current version only works with a direct connection to the Dynamixel bus
for servos set for communication at 1 Mbps (which is the default). The application has only been tested with AX-12+ but should work also with other
Dynamixels.

<h2>
Preliminaries
</h2>

<p>
The USB2Dynamixel uses an FTDI chip to convert from USB to serial communication.
The <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">driver</a> for this chip is not installed by default in OS X and if you do not already have it 
installed you will need to download them from <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/">FTDIs homepage</a> (Look for the VCP versions). 
</p>

<p>
The name of the serial device needs to be set in the preferences. To determine the name of the device open the Terminal application and write "cd /dev" followed by "ls" when the USB2Dynamixel is connected.
This will show a very long list of device names and the one for the USB2Dynamixel will be something like "/dev/cu.usbserial-A7005Lxn". Enter this string in the preferences.
</p>


<h2>
Connecting
</h2>

<p>
Press the Connect button below the ID list to connect to the USB2Dynamixel. The application will scan for servos
(in the range 0-31) on the bus and list them above the button.

<h2>
Controlling the Servos
</h2>

<p>
Select a servo from the list to look at the values in its control table. The values are displayed as raw data and translated to correct units.
The goal position and speed of a servo can be controlled by moving the two sliders to the right. Care is taken by the application to keep the position
slider in sync with the servo to avoid unexpected rapid movements. The "Moving Speed" sets the speed that will be used when the "Goal Position" slider 
is moved. When the "Moving Speed" is to the far right, speed control will be disabled (by setting the speed to 0) which will result in a maximal speed.

<h2>
Turning the servos on and off
</h2>

<p>
Each individual servo can be turned on or off with the Torque Enable check box.
To enable or disable the torque of all servos on the bus, use the Enable and Disable buttons in the Broadcast box.
</p>

<h2>
Editing 
</h2>

<p>
It is not currently possible to edit any other values than goal position and speed, but this will be added in the next version.

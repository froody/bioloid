Rough unsorted list of things to do:

* Find some way of representing linked pages
* Real code for playing pages, that does S-curves, etc
	* I'm working on it!
* Serial/zigbee support, because the bioloid cables are too short
	* This will need some integration with firmware, etc
* Fancy 3D Visualisation of poses (could borrow some code from https://sourceforge.net/projects/bioloidcontrol/)
* Maybe switch to make it not a doc-based app, there's no real need for this since there's only one view.
* Clean up!
* Editable fields (so you can change the punch, etc)
	* Optionally broadcast settings like this to a subset of motors
* Saving of motion files, recording of poses for playback, etc
* Mini-preview of motor angles in ID list
* better interface for selecting motors to control

 May need to do the SSH authentication stuff first...?

 -------  Announcement Text -------  

There's now a physics simulator in the bioloidcontrol project.  It is a close-to-realistic simulation of the bioloid humanoid robot.  Here are some key features :

* Written in C++ : with a decent object hierarchy (IMHO)
* Complete bioloid bus simulator drivable via TCP (all commands)
* Realistic physics : dimensions, masses, inertias taken from Portugeuse research group
* Robot parameters created from Excel file (via a perl-to-XML translator)
* Bioloid components (servos, IMUs, etc) react to bioloid message packets realistically
* Code is readable and extensible (and open source)

At the moment it's just accessible via SVN, and only tested on Linux.  There are full instructions on building and running the simulator at :
http://bioloidcontrol.sourceforge.net/index_new.php?category=11

If there are problems it's probably my fault, and I'd be happy to help out with any vitual robot problems : BioloidControl (at) PLATFORMedia.com

Have fun!

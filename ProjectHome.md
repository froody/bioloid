Welcome! Take a look at the [Projects List](Projects.md)

This is intended to be a common place for all sorts of code and information about programming with the Bioloid system including, but not limited to:

  * Custom firmware for the CM-5, CM-510, etc
  * Code for other micro-controllers & desktop OS's to talk on the Dynamixel bus for driving servos, using sensors, etc
  * Desktop OS utilities related to the robots, i.e. bootloaders, visualisation/simulation, motion file editors, external video processing, etc
  * Motion files
  * Documentation on how everything works

This is meant to be as open as possible:

  * If you've done something cool, please share it!
  * Even if you think the code is messy, submit it anyway and clean it up later, or let other people clean it up for you.
  * If you're unsure whether something will be useful or not, check it in anyway, you can always remove it later.
  * If you have gotten the message yet, please submit your work! The only way this project can become useful is if we have a lot of people checking in cool stuff

If you want to check in stuff, join the project and then send an email to [bioloid-discuss@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/group/bioloid-discuss) and I'll try and find a good place to put it, in order to keep the repository semi-organised.
